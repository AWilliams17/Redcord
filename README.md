## Redcord - It's a Discord Reddit-style reputation bot
### Why would you do this.
Learn Kotlin and Discord bots, and because this is the worst idea I've ever had for a bot.
An idea so stupendously terrible, that it just had to be made.

### Why though
Truly, reputation is the epitome of online forums and communities.
Nothing bad has ever come from such a system being implemented. Discord is truly the
most marvelous piece of software ever made, the pinnacle of software engineering and
dare I say - human achievement. All it is missing is that one feature to make it
truly exemplary.

*(I am so so sorry)*

### Features/Plans
At the moment literally all it does is just upvote new messages in the server.  
Eventually I hope to it have it doing ridiculous things like tracking the total amount
of 'reputation' user(s) have accumulated over time in the server being tracked, possibly  
some sort of an annoying login feature, etc... Basically the penultimate goal here is to  
make a bot that makes the end experience as annoying and intrusive as possible but in a  
way that doesn't completely destroy the server.
